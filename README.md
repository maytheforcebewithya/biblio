# `biblio` - A Library Management System

---

\vspace{2cm}

## Abstract

Biblio - A Library Management System project aims to create a comprehensive solution for library management, targeting the needs of a librarian. This system facilitates the efficient handling of book inventories, including the addition and consolidation of new book orders. It allows for effortless filtering of books by various attributes such as author, publisher, and genre. The system streamlines the borrowing and returning process, ensures meticulous tracking of transactions, and handles fines for overdue books. Additionally, it maintains accurate records of authors, publishers, and patrons, while providing real-time library statistics. The application is designed to be user-friendly and supports containerized deployment for seamless integration and operation.

============================================================

<br>
<br>

### Requirement Collection

The Library Management System must consist of a LIBRARY database that comprehensively track all books, each identified by an ISBN, and record details such as title, author, publisher, publication year, and genre. Separate sections for authors and publishers are necessary, including full names for authors and names for publishers. Managing the book inventory, including the number of copies, availability status, and overdue status, is essential. Patron information, including name, address, phone number, email, and unique student numbers (USNs) for students, must be accurately stored. The system must track which patrons borrow which books, recording check-out and return dates, and apply fines for late returns. It should distinguish between active and inactive patrons, facilitate the easy addition of new books and patrons while avoiding duplicates, and allow straightforward searches for books by author or genre. A user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation for staff members is required. The system should provide access to library statistics, such as the number of checked-out books and popular genres, and support updating or deleting outdated or incorrect records. Additionally, managing different editions of books with the same title must ensure they are not confused.

### Requirement Analysis
Here is a dissected list of requirements for the Library Management System from a client:

1. It is necessary to keep track of all books. Each book should have its own ISBN number, title, author, publisher, publication year, and genre.

2. Separate sections for authors and publishers are required. For authors, their full names should be included. For publishers, their names are needed.

3. Managing the book inventory is essential, including the number of copies of each book, their availability status (available or checked out), and whether they are overdue.

4. Storing information about patrons, including name, address, phone number, and email, is necessary. For students, their unique student numbers (USNs) must be stored and ensured for accuracy.

5. Keeping track of which patrons are borrowing which books is crucial. This includes recording when a book is checked out and returned. If a book is returned late, a fine should be charged.

6. It should be easy to see which patrons currently have books checked out ("active") and which ones do not ("inactive").

7. Frequently acquiring new books and new patrons means the system must allow easy additions while avoiding duplicates.

8. The ability to search for books easily is necessary. For example, finding all books by a certain author or in a specific genre should be straightforward.

9. The system should have a user-friendly interface, with intuitive buttons and menus to facilitate ease of use by all staff members.

10. Accessing statistics about the library, such as the number of books currently checked out and the most popular genres, will aid in planning.

11. The ability to update information, such as a patronâ€™s address or correcting a book title, is needed. Outdated or incorrect records should also be deletable.

12. Managing different publications of books with the same title is essential, ensuring they are not mixed up.

Through surveys and observations, it was determined that the end user of such an application would be a Librarian. The Librarian might use manual methods or IoT-enhanced techniques to enter inventory identifiers to facilitate issues, returns, and fine collection. On receiving book orders, the author, the publisher of the said book(s) are added to the database if not already there to enhance ease of filtering books required by a patron, without having to go through tedious manual searches throughout the library racks.

Here are the requirements that were determined from requirement collection:

- Addition and consolidation of book orders received by the Library. 

- Effortless filtering of books by attributes like author name, publisher, genre and the like.

- Enabling easy borrows and returns by patrons. Meticulous tracking of such transactions.

- Auto-incremented indexable and searchable IDs for authors, publishers and transactions.

- Consistent use of ISBN-13 format throughout all book records.

- Tracking patron status as Active or Inactive (Active being posession of a library book, and Inactive being the lack thereof).

- Addition of patrons should not allow duplication of Authors, Patron phone numbers, IDs or email IDs.

- Validation for VTU USNs (Patron IDs) for student patrons in the educational institution.

- Tracking book copies as available, or overdue, avoiding conflict in transaction.

- Year-of-publishing-wise maintenance of the book database to avoid erroneous categorization of a book with different editions.

- Fine increment on exceeding borrow period without renewal.

- Easily accessbile real-time library statistics.

- Containerized deployment with a strongly connected backend and a frontend.

- Update and Delete operations for all relevant entities.

- Worker functions to add fines, regularly list due books, and such time-related operations should remain functional during server uptime.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram

## Conversion to a Relational Model - Using the seven-step algorithm for ER diagram conversion

#### 1. Map Regular Entities

Relations included:
 - Patron 
 - Publisher
 - Author
 - Book
 - BookCopy

![Step - 1](demoassets/step_1.jpg){ width=50% }

#### 2. Map Weak Entities

Since there are no weak entities in this ER diagram, this step is skipped.

#### 3. Map Binary 1:1 Relationships

Since there are no 1:1 relationships in this diagram, this step is skipped.

#### 4. Map Binary 1:N Relationships

  - Add `author_id` as a foreign key to the `Book` table.
  - Add `publisher_id` as a foreign key to the `Book` table.
  - Add `isbn` as a foreign key to the `BookCopy` table.

![Step - 4](demoassets/step_4.jpg){ width=50% }

#### 5. Map Binary M:N Relationships

  - Create relation: `Borrows(id, patron_id, copy_id, borrow_date, due_date, return_date)`
  - Primary key: `id`
  - Foreign keys: `patron_id` references `Patron(id)`, `copy_id` references `BookCopy(id)`

![Step - 5](demoassets/biblioschema.jpg){ width=50% }

#### 6. Map Multivalued Attributes

Since there are no multivalued attributes in this ER diagram, this step is skipped.
_It could be considered the the Author and Publisher attributes for a book are multi-valued. However, referring to the requirements, we see that it was mentioned that effortless filtering of books by author, publisher and genre was a required feature already._

#### 7. Map N-ary Relationships

Since there are no n-ary (n > 2) relationships in this diagram, this step is skipped.

### Additional Considerations

#### 1. Composite Attributes

Split composite attributes into their components:
- **Patron:** Split `name` into `first_name` and `last_name`.
- **Author:** Split `name` into `first_name`, `midname_initial`, and `last_name`.

#### 2. Data Types

Assign appropriate data types to each attribute based on the nature of the data it will store. For example:
- Used `VARCHAR` for variable-length string data (names, email, etc.).
- Used `INTEGER` for numeric data (id, qty, etc.).
- Used `DATE` for date fields (borrow_date, due_date, return_date).

#### 3. Constraints

Added constraints to ensure data integrity:
- Set `NOT NULL` for mandatory fields.
- Added `UNIQUE` constraints where appropriate (e.g., `email` in the `Patron` table).
- Defined `CHECK` constraints for fields with limited values (e.g., `status` in the `Patron` table).

#### 4. Indexes

Created indexes on frequently queried fields to improve performance.

### Analysis against Normal Forms (first normal form, second normal form, third normal form, and the Boyle-Codd normal form)

1. Patron:
   - 1NF: Yes, all attributes are atomic.
   - 2NF: Yes, all non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key (id).
   - 3NF: Yes, no transitive dependencies.

2. Publisher:
   - 1NF: Yes, all attributes are atomic.
   - 2NF: Yes, all non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key (id).
   - 3NF: Yes, no transitive dependencies.

3. Author:
   - 1NF: Yes, all attributes are atomic.
   - 2NF: Yes, all non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key (id).
   - 3NF: Yes, no transitive dependencies.

4. Book:
   - 1NF: Yes, all attributes are atomic.
   - 2NF: Yes, all non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key (isbn).
   - 3NF: Yes, no transitive dependencies.

5. BookCopy:
   - 1NF: Yes, all attributes are atomic.
   - 2NF: Yes, all non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key (id).
   - 3NF: Yes, no transitive dependencies.

6. Borrows:
   - 1NF: Yes, all attributes are atomic.
   - 2NF: Yes, all non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key (id).
   - 3NF: Yes, no transitive dependencies.

Thus, the relational schema is overall in the Third Normal Form

### Python Implementation of some Notable CRUD (Create - Read - Update - Delete) functions using SQLModel ORM

There are a total of 44 CRUD functions used in this project. Here are 16 notable functions that perform database operations:

1. **`get_available_bookcopies`** - Retrieves a list of available book copies that have not been borrowed.

```python
def get_available_bookcopies(session: Session = Depends(get_session)):
    try:
        borrowed_copies_subquery = select(Borrows.copy_id).where(Borrows.return_date.is_
        (None)).subquery()
        operation = (
            select(BookCopy, Book, Author, Publisher)
            .join(Book, BookCopy.isbn == Book.isbn)
            .join(Author, Book.author_id == Author.id)
            .join(Publisher, Book.publisher_id == Publisher.id)
            .where(BookCopy.id.not_in(borrowed_copies_subquery))
        )
        result = session.exec(operation).all()
        if not result:
            return []
        
        available_bookcopies = [
            {
                "id": bookcopy.id,
                "isbn": bookcopy.isbn,
                "title": book.title,
                "author": f"{author.first_name} {author.midname_initial} 
                {author.last_name}",
                "publisher": publisher.name
            }
            for bookcopy, book, author, publisher in result
        ]
        return available_bookcopies
    except IntegrityError:
        session.rollback()
        raise DBIntegrityError
    except DatabaseError:
        session.rollback()
        raise DatabaseError
```

2. **`get_overdue_bookcopies`** - Fetches a list of book copies that are overdue for return.

```python
def get_overdue_bookcopies(session: Session = Depends(get_session)):
    try:
        today = date.today()
        operation = (
            select(Borrows, BookCopy, Book, Author, Publisher)
            .join(BookCopy, Borrows.copy_id == BookCopy.id)
            .join(Book, BookCopy.isbn == Book.isbn)
            .join(Author, Book.author_id == Author.id)
            .join(Publisher, Book.publisher_id == Publisher.id)
            .where(Borrows.due_date < today)
            .where(Borrows.return_date == None)
        )
        result = session.exec(operation).all()
        if not result:
            return []
        overdue_bookcopies = [
            {
                **borrow.dict(),
                **bookcopy.dict(),
                "title": book.title,
                "author": f"{author.first_name} {author.midname_initial} 
                {author.last_name}",
                "publisher": publisher.name
            }
            for borrow, bookcopy, book, author, publisher in result
        ]
        return overdue_bookcopies
    except IntegrityError:
        session.rollback()
        raise DBIntegrityError
    except SQLAlchemyDatabaseError:
        session.rollback()
        raise DatabaseError
```

3. **`get_all_borrows`** - Returns a list of all borrow transactions along with related book and patron details.

```python
def get_all_borrows(session: Session = Depends(get_session)):
    try:
        operation = (
            select(Borrows, BookCopy, Book, Author, Publisher)
            .join(BookCopy, Borrows.copy_id == BookCopy.id)
            .join(Book, BookCopy.isbn == Book.isbn)
            .join(Author, Book.author_id == Author.id)
            .join(Publisher, Book.publisher_id == Publisher.id)
        )
        result = session.exec(operation).all()
        if not result:
            return {
                "message": "No borrows transacted yet."
            }
        borrows = [
            {
                **borrow.dict(),
                **bookcopy.dict(),
                "title": book.title,
                "author": f"{author.first_name} {author.midname_initial} 
                {author.last_name}",
                "publisher": publisher.name
            }
            for borrow, bookcopy, book, author, publisher in result
        ]
        return borrows
    except IntegrityError:
        session.rollback()
        raise DBIntegrityError
    except SQLAlchemyDatabaseError:
        session.rollback()
        raise DatabaseError
```

4. `create_borrow` - Adds a new borrow transaction for a book copy by a patron.

```python
def create_borrow(body: AddBorrow, session: Session = Depends(get_session)):
    try:
        book_copy = session.exec(select(BookCopy).where(BookCopy.id == body.copy_id))
        .one_or_none()
        if not book_copy:
            raise NotFoundException(detail="Book copy not found")
        
        book = session.exec(select(Book).where(Book.isbn == book_copy.isbn)).one_or_none()
        if not book:
            raise NotFoundException(detail="Associated book not found")
        existing_borrow = session.exec(select(Borrows).where(Borrows.copy_id == 
        body.copy_id).where(Borrows.return_date == None)).one_or_none()
        if existing_borrow:
            raise DuplicateEntryException(detail=DUPLICATE_BORROW)
        duplicate_borrow = session.exec(select(Borrows).where(Borrows.patron_id == 
        body.patron_id).where(Borrows.copy_id == body.copy_id).where(Borrows.borrow_date 
        == body.borrow_date)).one_or_none()
        if duplicate_borrow:
            raise DuplicateEntryException(detail="This book has already been borrowed")
        borrow = Borrows(
            patron_id=body.patron_id,

# Tech Stack

- The `biblio` backend uses a REST API Python backend framework called FastAPI. All endpoints, requests, and retrievals are done via the FastAPI server code

- The `biblio` backend uses an SQLite database with an SQLModel ORM that implements queries in Python Code. All models are designed using SQLModel. Request Validation is done using Pydantic models.

- The `biblio` frontend uses Streamlit for a blazing-fast, simple yet intuitive interface.

--- 

# Instructions 

`biblio` uses docker for containerization. One can pull the project to a local repository, `cd` into the repository and run `sudo docker-compose up --build`. Ports 8000 and 8051 need to be left free in order to run the application. The application can be accessed at l`http://0.0.0.0:8051/`

---

2. **User-Friendly Frontend**: The Streamlit-based frontend offers an intuitive and responsive user interface, making library management tasks accessible and straightforward.

3. **Comprehensive CRUD Operations**: The system provides full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for all major entities (books, authors, publishers, patrons, borrows).

4. **Advanced Search Capabilities**: Users can search for books, authors, publishers, and patrons using various criteria, enhancing the system's usability.

5. **Automated Tasks**: The background scheduler for calculating patron fines demonstrates the system's capability for automation, reducing manual workload.

6. **Data Integrity**: Through the use of SQLModel and Pydantic, the system ensures data validation and integrity at both the database and application levels.

7. **Scalable Architecture**: The modular design, with separate routers for each resource, allows for easy maintenance and future expansion.

8. **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose integration ensures easy deployment and consistency across different environments.

9. **Detailed Reporting**: The system provides various aggregate functions and reports, offering valuable insights into library operations.

10. **Flexible and Extensible**: The well-structured codebase allows for easy addition of new features or modification of existing ones.

In conclusion, the Biblio Library Management System represents a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly solution for modern libraries.
